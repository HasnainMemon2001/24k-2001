Q: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it is an even number or odd number as well.

•	Enter the number n (n= The number to be divided) 
•	Enter the number Nth (N=remainder is zero)
•	If (n % Nth==0)
•	Display "Nth is a divisor of n".
•	If (Nth % 2==0)
•	Display “The Nth is an even number” and “divisor of n number” 
•	Else 
•	Display “The Nth is an odd number” and “divisor of n number”
•	Endif 
•	Else 
•	Display “Nth is not a divisor of n”
•	Endif
