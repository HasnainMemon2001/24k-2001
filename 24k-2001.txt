Objective 2: PSEUDOCODE 

Q: Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)
Problem 2;
Start 
Int= operator and result 
Print: Enter the two numbers
Declare number 1 = x, number 2 = y
Input: Enter the number 1 
Input: Enter the operator(+,-)
Input: Enter the number 2
If (operator==+)
Calculate: x + y
Else 
Calculate: x – y
Display: “The result is”, result
End

Q# Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator (Use your head for this)
Problem 3;
Start
Display: Enter three numbers
Input: Enter the first number
Input: Enter the second number
Input: Enter the third number
Declare first number = x, second number = y and third number = z
Initialize result1= x – (- y)
Initialize result = result1 – (- z)
Display: "The sum is: “, result
End




Objective 3: ALGORITHM

Q# 1 Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*, /, %)
       Problem 1;

•	Enter the two numbers
•	Declare number 1 = x, number 2 = y
•	Enter the number 1
•	Enter the operator (+, -, *, /, %)
•	Enter the number 2
•	If (operator == +)
•	Calculate x + y
•	Else if (operator == -)
•	Calculate x – y
•	Else if (operator ==*)
•	Calculate x*y
•	Else if (operator ==/)
•	If (y! = 0)
•	Calculate x/y
•	Else
•	Error, division by zero is not allow
•	Endif
•	Else
•	If (y! = 0)
•	Calculate x % y
•	Else
•	Error, division is not allowed by zero
•	Endif
•	Endif
•	Display to the user, “The result is”
•	End
Q#2 Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it is an even number or odd number as well.

         Problem 3;

•	Enter the number n (n= The number to be divided) 
•	Enter the number Nth (N=remainder is zero)
•	If (n % Nth==0)
•	Display "Nth is a divisor of n".
•	If (Nth % 2==0)
•	Display “The Nth is an even number” and “divisor of n number” 
•	Else 
•	Display “The Nth is an odd number” and “divisor of n number”
•	Endif 
•	Else 
•	Display “Nth is not a divisor of n”
•	Endif
